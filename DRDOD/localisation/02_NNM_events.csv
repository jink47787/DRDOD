EVTNAME10222;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10222;Angry crowds have flooded the streets of Paris, shouting cries of 'Down with the King!' and 'Long live the Reform!'. They have erected barricades in the streets and fighting has broken out with the Parisian municipal guards. With the city having been completely closed off from outside help, these crowds have begun to march on the royal palace. Our king has had no choice but to abdicate and flee the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10223;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10223;Facing the prospect of losing the presidential election, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10224;Emperor Napoleon Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10224;Angered by the inability of France to prevent the formation of Germany, as well as the humiliating loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the government has deposed Emperor Napoleon. We must choose what form our new government is to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11108;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11108;The call has gone out for the Slavic nations of the Balkans to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Austrians and Turks as well as other European powers. Yugoslavia, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours. Whether this new nation would succeed in holding together a people divided by centuries of bitter warfare is best left for speculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13056;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell. Wherever there is an unexposed harbor, a foreign ship soon docks, and drives another fang into our national body. The use of opium has spread throughout $STATENAME$.;Les grands voiliers de commerce sillonent nos côtes du nord au sud, comme des loups à l'abattage des faibles et des corruptibles avec le poison qu'ils vendent. Partout où il y a un port non encore exposé, un navire étranger accoste bientôt, et plante un autre croc dans notre organisme national. L'usage de l'opium s'est étendue à $PROVINCENAME$. ;Die großen Klipper fahren unsere Küste von Norden nach Süden ab, wie Wölfe, die sich die Schwächsten aus der Herde suchen - in diesem Fall die mit ihrem wohlfeilen Gift Korrumpierbaren. Wo immer sich ein neuer Hafen findet, ankert bald ein ausländisches Schiff und rammt einen weiteren Reißzahn in den Körper unserer Nation. Der Opiumgebrauch hat sich nach $PROVINCENAME$ ausgebreitet.;;Los grandes veleros clíper navegan por nuestras costas, recorriéndolas de norte a sur, como lobos que acechan a los débiles y corruptibles con el veneno que venden. Cuando encuentran un puerto desprotegido, un barco extranjero atraca y clava su colmillo en el cuerpo de nuestra nación. El uso del opio se ha extendido a $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13365;Boxers Occupy Foreign-Held Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13365;The Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists have invaded lands currently owned by a colonial power, but which rightfully belong to the Chinese. More than that, they have successfully occupied the territory and rebuffed efforts by westerners to take it back. We can attempt to stake our claim over the land once again," though if we do it is all but tantamount to a declaration of war-- and, considering the state the Qing Empire is in", it might be a war in which we stand to lose more than we gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13370;The Boxers Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13370;$CAPITAL$ has been occupied by the Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists, who have successfully driven foreign influence out of the country and restored it to its traditional policies of isolationism. What repercussions this will cause with the western powers remains to be seen, but for the moment the Empire stands triumphant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44356;Second Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44356;The second stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Calgary to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the last stage, which will be the longest and most difficult yet as it requires creating a pass through the Rocky Mountains themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco-- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46304;Solano's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46304;The dictator of Paraguay, Solano Lopez, has turned his eye towards Brazilian lands to the southeast. Direct access to the Atlantic Ocean would be of great benefit to the country, rather than relying on Uruguayan permission to use the river-- permission which might not always be forthcoming, thanks to Brazilian interference. Perhaps it is time to flex Paraguay's muscle and establish an empire of our own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80111;The Dungan Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80111;Now that the rebellion in distant Xinjiang is finished, there appears to be some question as to who has ownership over the Dungan basin. The western half of the basin, in Qaratal, is occupied by the wicked Russians… but they wish control over the eastern half in Ili, as well. Should we surrender the basin peacefully, or fight for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90034;Union With Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90034;The time has come to unite with our Greek brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95076;The January Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95076;A spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army has quickly erupted into a widespread insurrection, supported by high-ranking Polish and Lithuanian officers and politicians. The eyes of all of Europe are upon us, and if we deal with the insurgents too harshly it may hurt our relations with European powers. If we do not, however, the uprising may spread even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95315;Join the Canadian Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95315;With things in $COUNTRY$ so difficult, some citizens have brought up the possibility of joining the Confederation of Canada. It is a land of freedom, and together we will be more powerful than we are separately. Shall we approach their government?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95316;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks to Join Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95316;A delegate from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has quietly approached the Canadian government, asking for the former American state to be admitted to Confederation. While this may seem like a good idea, the Americans may see us as opportunists for accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97571;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97571;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98000;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98000;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98001;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98001;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98002;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98002;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98003;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98003;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98004;South Africa is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98004;We control the entire Cape Colony. There is no question now as to who the masters are in South Africa: the Boers. The time has come for us to end the war and unite the Boers under a single flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98005;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98005;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98006;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98006;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave the Cape Colony behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98735;Islamic Fervor in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98735;A sentiment of Islamic nationalism is sweeping $COUNTRY$, as people begin to clamor for unification with the Islamic Caliphate. We have little reason to doubt that they would object to a petition of annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME199006;Prospector Strikes Copper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199006;We have reports from $PROVINCENAME$ that a new vein of copper has been discovered, and considering the unemployment in $PROVINCENAME$ this might prove to be a boon indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME199008;Prospector Strikes Lead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
